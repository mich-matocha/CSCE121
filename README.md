# CSCE121
Introduction to Program Design and Concepts

According to the Texas A&M course catalog, this class is all about: 
"Computation to enhance problem solving abilities; computational thinking; 
  understanding how people communicate with computers, how computing affects society;
  design and implementation of algorithms; data types, program control, iteration, functions, classes, and exceptions;
  understanding abstraction, modularity, code reuse, debugging, maintenance, and other aspects of software development;
  development and execution of programs. "

My favorite part of CSCE 121 was learning C++ in general, and improving my debugging skills.
